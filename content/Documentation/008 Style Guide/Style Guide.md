# Dueling Minds Styleguide

[[content/index|HOME]]

The intention of this style guide is for it to be a living document. Changes and additions to be added as issues are raised and decided on. Feel free to leave comments and discussions.

## Universal

  
### Capitalization

When using board titles such as ‘technology chair’ only capitalize the job title when it directly precedes a person’s name. Be mindful of commas and appositive phrases which do not require capitalization.(APA)


As in: “Board Member Ada Lovelace voted to…” 

Not: “Ada Lovelace voted as a Board Member to…”

And Not: “A Board Member, Ada Lovelace, voted today to…”: 


The portions highlighted in red above, should be lowercase.

### Headings

- Note: Heading formatting does not have to be strict in our application. As Dueling Minds is not publishing academic material at this time. This only serves as a default guideline.
    

### Quotations Longer Than 40 Words

When using a quotation of more than 40 words, arrange the quotation into a separate block on the page. There are several important rules regarding block quotations:

- Start a block quotation on a separate line and indent it and all subsequent lines by 1.27 cm (0.5 inches). For multi-paragraph quotes, indent the first line of each subsequent paragraph an additional 1.27 cm (0.5 inches).
    
- Do not use quotation marks. Use a signal phrase before the quote and include the page/paragraph number after the quote’s closing punctuation, or include the author, year, and page/paragraph number in parentheses after the quote’s closing punctuation.
    

Example:

>Smith (2010) described the use of long quotations:
>
>>Long quotations can serve an important role. They can permit an author to share relevant ideas and provide context that may be helpful for the reader. However, long quotes are also frequently overused and should only be included when they are needed. (para. 3)
