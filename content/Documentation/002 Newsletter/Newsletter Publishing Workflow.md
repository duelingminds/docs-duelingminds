This section assumes you have accepted a topic on [[Trello Workflow|Trello]] for revision and have opened copies of the relevant notes from the Google Drive shared folder. 
### Storing Files

All files related to the newsletter are first staged in our Google [[Cloud Storage]] drive. Access to this drive is provided through the volunteer Discord. Refer to the prior mentioned page for general reference about file storage.

### Markdown

Markdown is a very versatile way to store formatted text that allows copying between various services without the need to re-apply formatting. There are many markdown text editors that are free and on any platform that you can feel free to use to have a visual preview of your edits, but the final text must be stored in Google Docs as plain text for easy copy and paste between various platforms.


See [[Google Docs Settings]] for removing the automatic formatting that Google docs applies when typing or pasting in text, as it interferes with the process of copying the plain markdown. Preview existing files if necessary for an example of what your submitted documents should look like.


Other notes:
- Make sure indentation is done with 4 spaces, not tab key. This includes hyphenated lists.

#### Free visual Markdown editors

- [Obsidian.md](https://Obsidian.md) - free software on all platforms - Previews formatting as you type (WYSIWYG)

### Step by Step


1. Compile notes from other volunteers into the editor of your choice.
2. Edit notes following guidelines in the [[Style Guide]] on tone and formatting (using markdown syntax)
3. Add your own insights and re word as you feel is necessary until you have a complete Topic section.
4. Copy or export your plain markdown text and paste it into the Newsletter folder in the [[Cloud Storage]] drive. Remember to follow the [[Cloud Storage#File Naming Convention|naming conventions]] for the file.
5. Update the [[Trello Workflow|Trello]] card with an attachment link to the file you have created in the shared folder! If this is your last assigned card, you are done!
