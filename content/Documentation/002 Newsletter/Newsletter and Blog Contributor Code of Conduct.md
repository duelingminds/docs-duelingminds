# Code of Conduct for Contributors to the Newsletter



In addition to the general Volunteer [[Code of Conduct]] some additional rules and guidelines apply to newsletter and blog post contributors, which are outlined below.

##  Use of AI Tools Policy

The use of AI generated output specifically to compose the content of the newsletter is not permitted.

We do not have a specific policy regarding the use of AI tools to help parse or organize notes/transcripts, as the contributor deems helpful. But all published words must be composed by members of the team.

>[!NOTE] From the Board
>While we advocate for the use of AI to augment and aid us in our personal lives for coping with the demands placed on AuDHD individuals. This does not supersede the need to be ethical in its application. Multiple people collaborate and contribute to the newsletter and the integrity of any individual's contribution should not be called into question by the presence of AI generated content potentially being associated or attributed to them, especially without their consent to its use.

## Original Works Policy

Along the same train of thought as our AI policy, content that is not a specific quote should be in the author's own words. See the [[Style Guide]] for how to properly attribute quotes.
## Identifiable Information Policy

Content distributed in newsletters and blog posts should not contain personally identifiable information, or direct anecdotes without express written consent. Examples from personal experience, if included, should be anonymized or re-written to exclude personal identifiers or specific details of the person(s) involved.
## Author Credit

As a community volunteer effort, contributions to the newsletter should be acknowledged and all volunteers contributing to a particular post will be credited with either a 'by' line or 'contributing editor' credit. This will be determined by the editor in charge of distribution. Volunteers may contact the editor in charge of the newsletter with questions or concerns regarding authorship credit.
