## Google Drive

The shared drive folder is a community maintained cloud storage solution that hosts all of the drafts for newsletter materials to be collaborated on. Contact one of the volunteer leaders or Dueling Minds staff in the volunteer discord to be given access.

Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with this guide as well as the instructions regarding referencing Drive files in the  [[Trello Workflow]] 

>[!warning] Attention
>Please do not delete or move files outside of the areas designated in this document. If you have concerns about the folder structure, raise them with those in charge of maintaining the documentation.

## File Naming Convention

All files pertaining to a specific newsletter or post should be prepended by the date of the meeting they are associated with. Or the date of publication in cases where that does not apply.

Dates should be in International Organization for Standardization (ISO) format. Following a Year-month-day pattern: YYYY-MM-DD

e.g. 2024-03-10 
Which indicates March 3rd, 2024

Note above the leading zero in the month '03'. This is mandatory for sorting consistency. As well as for the day section. as in: 2024-10-03 

>[!note] Why?
>The YYYY-MM-DD format allows files to be in chronological order, even if sorted by name. However it only works if it is consistently followed. For, example, a file accidentally named 2024-1-10  (January 10th) would appear AFTER a file named 2024-10-10 (October 10th). Which could raise obvious issues.

Example newsletter draft and contributor's submitted notes filenames:

>2024-05-06 Ada's peer support notes
>2024-05-06 Newsletter Draft

For files created for a meeting on May 6th, 2024

### Attachment naming

Prepend the date of the article as well as the intended section heading of the newsletter if applicable.

### Templates

Templates are provided to copy and give minimal structure to begin a draft. Any file intended as a template should be prepended by an '' `_` '' underscore. to bring them to the top of alphabetical sorting and clearly denote the purpose and that it is a template in the filename.

e.g. `_Newsletter Draft Template`

## Folder Structure

Currently in progress documents pertaining to newsletters and posts that have yet to be published should appear in the root of the folder. Along with reference documents and raw attachments. (see [[Cloud Storage#Attachments|below]]) 
### Archives

When an article is published all associated documents should go into their respective 'archive' folders to be used for future reference.

## Attachments

Attachments should not be pasted or otherwise placed inside draft documents, but instead in the root of the folder as image files. Make sure these are the original file if possible and not a screen capture or otherwise too low quality for distribution. Seek out and replace a file with the original if one is not present for a given file. Consult the [[Style Guide]] for attribution requirements.
