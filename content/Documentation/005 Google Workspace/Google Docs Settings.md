### Settings

Google Drive is our [[Cloud Storage]] provider and collaboration space. Some settings need to be set by each user to have uniformity and ensure consistency throughout workflows crossing multiple platforms and involving multiple contributors.

### Markdown formatting settings
 
Markdown is a plain text way to format text. It uses symbols such as `#` , `*` and `-` to designate various formatting rules. 

Google Docs supports markdown, but to maintain interoperability. we don't actually want to convert this markdown into Google's formatted text. To make sure this is disabled:

- open a blank document in google docs
- go to tools -> preferences
- un check automatic list formatting and markdown support
- click on substitutions
- uncheck the substitutions for three dashes `---` and two dashes `--`
- click save

You should now be ready to input plain markdown into Google Docs.
